# Craving
Find a food truck, calm a craving.

[Final report of our design process](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs147/projects/ArtsCulture/Craving/reports/final.pdf)


Food trucks are often a reliable source of good, cheap, and convenient food. However we noticed through our needfinding that food trucks, due to their unreliable schedule, were being overlooked as a food source, and people's approach to finding food trucks varied quite a bit from the typical food discovery process. Since there weren't any food truck finder apps available, we decided to make one, focusing on redesigning the food discovery process to be tailored towards food trucks. Including features like the ability to:
- Find & keep track of trucks nearby
- Set reminders
- See reviews that aren't just walls of text
- Be rewarded with discounts


## Installation Instructions

Download the .zip from our website, and navigate to the folder containing the project:
```
npm install react-native-maps --save

npm install --save react-native-elements@beta

npm install yarn add react-native-typography

npm install --save react-native-modal-datetime-picker

npm install --save react-navigation

npm install --save react-native-snap-carousel

npm i -S react-native-multiple-tags

npm install --save react-native-progress-bar-animated

npm install --save react-native-onboarding-swiper

npm install --save react-native-tag-autocomplete

npm install react-native-popup-menu --save

expo start
```
Afterwards, scan the QR code with your phone (and install Expo if needed) to see our prototype!

## Operating Instructions
No special operating instructions.

## Implementation Limitations
- The prototype does not contain concepts of user accounts
  - Onboarding happens every time you launch the prototype
- All of the data in the app is hard-coded (dates, locations, profiles, etc.) 
  - Search on the map is hard-coded
- Changes in state do not persist across different views
  - I.e. following/unfollowing a truck does not persist, setting a reminder does not persist
  - Users can go through the flow of adding a review, but the review data is not saved anywhere and the screen does not update to include the userâ€™s review
- Users can add duplicate tags to a review; there is no edge case handling
- We envisioned many animated transitions (between screens, when overlays pop up, etc) that were not implemented
